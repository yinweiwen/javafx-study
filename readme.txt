Main class, named HelloApplication, sets up the main application window and launches your layout simulator. To run this code, a user needs to execute the HelloApplication class.

Here's a brief explanation of what this class does:

1. It creates an instance of your LayoutView class, which is your custom layout simulation.
2. It sets up a JavaFX Scene with your LayoutView as the root node. This scene is displayed within the application window.
3. The application window is configured with a title and dimensions (600x300 pixels).
4. Finally, the application window is shown using the stage.show() method.

Here's how a user can run this code:

1. Make sure you have Java and JavaFX installed on your system.
2. Compile your Java code, including the HelloApplication class.
3. Run the compiled code. You can do this by executing the main method in the HelloApplication class. If you're using an integrated development environment (IDE), you can typically run the application by right-clicking the HelloApplication class and selecting "Run" or "Debug."
4. After running the code, a window with your layout simulation should appear.
